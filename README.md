# Peer-To-Peer-Smart-Contracts
This project is an application designed to create **smart contracts utilizing the Lightning Network**, tailored for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions such as those found on Facebook Marketplace and similar platforms.

This project is an application designed to create **smart contracts utilizing the Lightning Network**, tailored for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions such as those found on Facebook Marketplace and similar platforms.

### Key Features
- **Automated Smart Contract Creation:** Users can input transaction details (such as item, price, and terms), and the app generates a custom smart contract for the deal.
- **Lightning Network Integration:** Leverages the speed, security, and low fees of the Lightning Network for real-time Bitcoin payments between parties.
- **Peer-to-Peer Use Case:** Optimized to facilitate trustless deals without intermediaries—perfect for online marketplace transactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple inputs allow anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to create and manage contracts.
- **Escrow Logic:** Funds can be locked in the contract until both parties fulfill their obligations, reducing risk of scams.

### Suggested Use Cases
- Buying and selling goods or services on platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or local P2P meetups.
- Any scenario where two parties want to ensure fair payment and delivery without a centralized escrow service.

### How It Works (Summary)
1. **User Input:** Buyer and seller enter deal terms into the app.
2. **Smart Contract Generation:** The app produces a Lightning Network-based smart contract enforcing the agreed terms.
3. **Transaction Execution:** Payment is made via the Lightning Network; funds are held until contract conditions are met.
4. **Settlement:** Contract executes logic to release payment or revert if terms aren’t satisfied.

There are several **apps and platforms that use the Lightning Network and smart contracts for peer-to-peer transactions**, though few are specifically tailored for marketplace scenarios like Facebook Marketplace. Here’s an overview of what’s currently available and emerging in this space:

### Existing Apps and Platforms

- **Strike:** This mobile app enables instant peer-to-peer payments using the Lightning Network. You can send bitcoin or fiat instantly and at low cost, primarily aimed at remittance and personal payments. Strike doesn’t explicitly create custom marketplace deals but does offer seamless Lightning payments between users[1].

- **Klever Wallet:** Klever offers easy, non-custodial Lightning payments, abstracting away channel management and making peer payments accessible to anyone. While it’s a wallet, its user interface does enable direct transactions, though it’s not purpose-built for smart contracts around marketplace deals[2].

- **Zap & Phoenix:** These wallets support Lightning Network transactions, allowing instant payments and swaps between regular Bitcoin and Lightning wallets. They’re focused on payment speed and efficiency, but don’t automate custom contract terms for marketplace scenarios[3].

#### Smart Contract Layers
- **RGB Protocol:** RGB is built atop the Lightning Network to enable rich smart contracts with Bitcoin payments. It’s not a consumer-facing app itself, but some developer projects are beginning to use RGB for peer-to-peer deals—potentially matching your concept as the technology matures[4][5].

- **Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs):** DLCs enable smart contracts based on oracle-supplied real-world events (e.g., item delivery). While most current use-cases focus on betting or finance, the underlying tech can be extended for marketplace transactions between two parties[6][5].

### Marketplace Use-Case
Most current apps on the Lightning Network **do not yet offer full automation of marketplace-style contracts** (escrow, delivery verification, dispute resolution), but several are in development using building blocks like:

- **Breez SDK:** The Breez SDK is onboarding apps that run on Lightning for peer-to-peer exchanges, such as Bitmo (buy/sell/send Bitcoin) and Bitpost (wish lists/payments for marketplace items)[7].
- **OpenNode:** Provides Lightning-powered payment infrastructure for merchants, including instant settlement and API integration that could be adapted for peer-to-peer commerce[1].

### Summary
- You **can** make peer-to-peer payments using Lightning-powered apps.
- Some developer platforms (RGB Protocol, DLCs) are now enabling richer smart contract functions suitable for marketplace-style transactions, but consumer apps offering end-to-end smart contracts for P2P deals on platforms like Facebook Marketplace remain emerging.
- For custom contracts and escrow, you may need bespoke development or track projects extending consumer features beyond payments into automated deal enforcement.

If you’re looking for a ready-made app that perfectly matches creating marketplace smart contracts via the Lightning Network, the space is developing—but wallets and payment apps with Lightning already offer fast, cheap, and direct P2P transactions as a foundation[4][1][3][7].
